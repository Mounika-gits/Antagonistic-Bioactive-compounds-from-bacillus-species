7.1 Isolation Of Bacteria 
7.1.2 serial dilution
Serial dilutions were performed to estimate the viable count of probiotic bacteria, primarily lactic acid bacteria, that are naturally present in fermented homemade dosa batter. After 24 hours of fermentation at room temperature, samples were collected. Sterile saline was used to create dilutions from 10 -1 to 10-8 and1 ml aliquots were plated on MRS agar, a selective medium for lactic acid bacteria. The plates were then incubated anaerobically for 24 hours.

7.1.2 Spread Plate Technique
 After the Incubation, the colonies on the 10⁻⁶, 10⁻⁷, and 10⁻⁸ dilutions were well-isolated and distinguishable. These colonies had morphological traits that are characteristic of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and were consistent across all plates. The observed features were:
Extent: Colonies might be little or medium-sized.
Colour: Mainly creamy white, which is typical of many LAB strains.
Form and Margin: The colonies had a round shape and smooth, complete edges.
Elevation and Texture: The majority of the colonies were convex and had a moist, silky surface texture.

7.1.4 Pure Culture Technique
The isolated pure bacterial colonies, homemade dosa batter samples that had been serially diluted were inoculated using streak plates. Plates marked with dilutions of (for example, DB1, DB8,) were kept at 37°C for 24 to 48 hours. Colony distribution along the streak lines was good, with noticeable areas on several plates' third and fourth quadrants. The observed colonies had a creamy white colour, a circular, convex shape, smooth edges, and no pigmentation. They were also non-mucoid, indicating a typical lactic acid bacterial morphology. The plates showed no signs of contamination or mixed growth.

7.2 BIOCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION
7.2.1Gram Staining
The dominance of Gram-positive bacteria in the dosa batter samples (DB10-1 to DB10-8) was confirmed by the Gram-positive reaction of all eight bacterial strains that were isolated. This implies that the majority of the microbial community is made up of bacteria that have thick peptidoglycan cell walls, which hold the crystal violet stain during Gram staining. The consistent Gram-positive reactions in all isolates could indicate the presence Of helpful lactic acid bacteria, which are typically present in fermented foods. These results suggest that the microbial community in dosa batter may have probiotic qualities.

The catalase test was preformed to determine the presence of the enzyme catalase in the bacterial strains. The appearance of bubbles upon the addition of hydrogen peroxide indicated a positive catalase reaction. Most probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) like Lactobacillus lacks the enzyme catalase. These characteristic supports their possible classification under genus bacillus or other catalase-positive probiotic candidates.

7.2.3 Methyl Red Voges Proskauer (Mrvp) Test
Methyl Red Test:
The Methyl Red test was conducted to evaluate the acid production capability of bacterial isolate obtained from homemade dosa batter. The MR reagent was added to glucose phosphate broth after Incubation. All the test tubes exhibited a red coloration at the top indicating a positive result. This confirms the bacterial isolates are capable of mixed fermentation.

7.2.6 ANTAGONISTIC ACTIVITY
Antagonistic activity was performed against four pathogenic bacteria—Escherichia coli, Bacillus spp, Klebsiella spp, and Streptococcus spp. —using eight different bacterial strains (DB-1 to DB-8). Two distinct time points were 24 hours and 72 hours; the experiment was conducted at these times. The 24-hour incubation period yielded among these the most consistent and positive antibacterial responses. Millimetre measurements of the inhibition zones represented the extent of pathogen development inhibition for each strain. After 24 hour most strains showed mild to excellent antibacterial action. The inhibition zones for E. coli ranged from 7 mm (DB-6) to 10 mm (DB-4), indicating that several isolates—especially DB-4 and DB-1—were powerful. DB-8 demonstrated significant activity against Bacillus spp. (12 mm), whereas DB-5 showed the smallest zone (5 mm). DB-1 and DB-3 showed more effectiveness against Klebsiella spp. (10 mm), while other strains were less effective. With DB-2 (11 mm), followed by DB-1 and DB-3 (8–9 mm), the best inhibition against Streptococcus spp. was noted. The results overall point to 24-hour incubation being best at demonstrating antibacterial activity; some strains, like DB-1, DB-3, and DB-8, have a broad spectrum.

7.3 ISOLATION OF BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS FROM BACTERIA BY COLUMN CHROMATOGRAPHY
The bioactive compounds were successfully extracted from the culture supernatants of four bacterial strains: S2, S3, J1, and J8 using column chromatography with a Chloroform and methanol (70:30) solvent system and silica as the stationary phase. The number of fractions obtained from each strain were as follows:
•	S2 – 3 fractions (F1, F2, F3)
•	S3 – 3 fractions (F1, F2, F3)
•	J1 – 3 fractions (F1, F2, F3)
•	J8 – 2 fractions (F1, F2)

Figure 21: Reconstitution of Dried Bacterial Extracts with Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) for Antibacterial Activity Testing
After drying, each fraction was reconstituted with 1 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and subjected to antibacterial testing using the well diffusion method on Mueller-Hinton (MH) agar plates against four test pathogens:
Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Streptococcus spp., and Bacillus spp.
•	Each plate was prepared with 7 wells: six loaded with test fractions (50 µL and 100 µL of F1, F2, F3) and one with a standard antibiotic as a positive control.
•	Plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours, and the zones of inhibition were measured.

7.4 ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY SCREENING:

Using the agar well diffusion method on Mueller-Hinton (MH) agar plates, the antimicrobial activity of the reconstituted DMSO extracts derived from the bioactive chromatographic fractions of strains DB-1 and DB-8 was assessed. Determining whether the compounds separated by column chromatography maintained functional bioactivity against the test pathogens (E. Coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus species, Bacillus species) was the goal. 

Following incubation, the plates were checked for antimicrobial activity, and the resulting zones of inhibition (which were measured in millimetres) were noted. The antimicrobial activity of each fraction at both concentrations was represented by the zone diameters.
DB-1 Sample:
Test Pathogen	Concentration
(50µl)	Concentration
(100 µl)
	F1	F2	F3	F1	F2	F3
Escherichia coli (mm)	_	_	_	10	_	7
Staphylococcus aureus (mm)	_	_	_	6	_	9
Klebsiella pneumoniae (mm)	_	_	_	10	6 	10
Bacillus subtilis (mm)	_	_	_	6	10	8
Table (12): Antibacterial Activity of S2 Fractions (F1 -F3) Against Pathogens at 50µL and 100µL Volumes
Interpretation:
Fractions F1, F2, and F3 from strain DB-1 were tested for antibacterial activity at two different volumes (50 µL and 100 µL). Zones of inhibition were consistently larger in the 100 µL volume than in the 50 µL, suggesting a dose-dependent increase in activity.
•	Strong activity against K. pneumoniae (10 mm) and E. coli (10 mm) was demonstrated by F1 (100 µL), indicating strong inhibitory qualities against Gram-negative bacteria.
•	Only Bacillus subtilis (10 mm) was significantly inhibited by F2 (100 µL); no other pathogens were significantly affected.
•	The most functionally diverse fraction from DB-1 was F3 (100 µL), which showed broad activity, particularly against Staphylococcus aureus (9 mm), K. pneumoniae (10 mm), and B. subtilis (8 mm).
•	With the exception of F1 (5 mm in diameter against B. subtilis), little to no inhibition was observed at 50 µL volumes, indicating that greater concentrations are required for efficient antimicrobial activity.

Although all three fractions displayed target-specific activity at higher concentrations, DB-1's F3 was the most effective overall.
DB-8 Sample:

         Test Pathogen	Concentration

Bacillus subtilis (mm)	5	_	7	_
Table (13): Antibacterial Activity of DB-8 Fractions (F1 & F2) Against Pathogens at 50µL and 100µL Volumes
Interpretation: 

At 100 µL volume, strain DB-8's fractions F1 and F2 continuously showed potent antibacterial activity. They were more effective than the 50 µL samples.

All tested pathogens were strongly and evenly inhibited by F1 (at 100 µL volume):
•	8 mm for E. Coli, 
•	6 mm for Staphylococcus, 
•	10 mm for Klebsiella, and 
•	7 mm for Bacillus

Both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria are covered by this pattern, which indicates broad-spectrum antibacterial activity.

F2 (100 µL concentration) had smaller zones and was only moderately effective:
•	E. Coli: 8 mm
•	Staphylococcus species: 8 mm
•	Klebsiella species: 7 mm

Only F1 exhibited a small amount of activity against Bacillus subtilis (5 mm) at 50 µL concentration, suggesting concentration-dependent inhibition.

7.5 SELECTION OF OPTIMAL FRACTION FOR LC-MS ANALYSIS:

Fraction F1 from strain DB-8 at 100 µL (designated as J8-F1) was chosen for additional LC-MS analysis based on the antibacterial screening of all extracted fractions for the following reasons:
•	Against each of the four tested pathogens, it demonstrated broad-spectrum antibacterial activity.
•	It demonstrated the most uniform and balanced inhibition of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria out of all the fractions (from both DB-1 and DB-8).
•	The 10 mm inhibition zone against K. pneumoniae was the highest, and the inhibition zones were on level as well as superior to those of other fractions.
•	Its performance indicates the presence of strong and stable bioactive elements, which calls for LC-MS chemical identification and characterisation.

This deliberate choice aids in concentrating research efforts on the most promising applicant for possible probiotic or therapeutic uses.

7.6 LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY-MASS SPECTROMETRY ANALYSIS (LC-MS):
Liquid Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to perform molecular profiling on the bioactive fraction J8-F1 that was isolated from the bacterial strain DB-8 (F1 at 100 µL). UV-absorbing compounds and their corresponding mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios were detected and characterized using electrospray ionization in positive mode (ES⁺) and a diode array detector (DAD) at 220 nm.
Graph 1: Diode Array Chromatogram
The Diode Array Detector (DAD) chromatogram for the bioactive fraction J8-F1 at 220 nm is shown in the first graph. The concentration of UV-absorbing substances in the sample is determined by this analysis, which mainly targets conjugated molecules and peptide-like structures.
 
Figure 23: J8-F1 Diode Array Chromatogram at 220 nm, displaying six peaks with a dominant compound at 0.80 min (90.07% area), indicating a single active constituent with high chemical purity.
Key Findings: 
•	At the retention times of 0.80, 1.12, 4.88, 5.00, 5.77, and 6.22 minutes, six major peaks were detected.
•	The most noticeable peak, which made up 90.07% of the entire area, appeared at 0.80 minutes, indicating the presence of a single dominant compound in high concentration.
•	The remaining peaks were minor components (all below 1%), with a secondary peak at 1.12 minutes contributing 7.48%.
•	The presence of detectable UV-active compounds was confirmed by the absorbance values, which ranged from approximately 0.0 to 1.25 AU.
Interpretation: 
According to the DAD chromatogram, the chemically concentrated bioactive extract from DB-8 (F1 fraction) consists of a single major compound and a number of smaller constituents. This compound is a strong candidate for additional structural characterization and is probably the cause of the observed antibacterial activity, as indicated by the dominance of the peak at 0.80 min. The compound is likely small or relatively non-polar, as indicated by the early retention times (before 1.5 min), and it elutes from the column rapidly.

Graph 2: Mass Spectrum
The mass spectrometric scan in positive electrospray ionization mode (ES⁺) is shown in the second graph. It provides information about the molecular makeup of the bioactive substances found in fraction J8-F1 by displaying the mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) of ionized fragments.  
Figure 24: Multiple bioactive compounds are indicated by the diverse profile of ionized molecular species ranging from m/z 100 to 684. Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrum (ES⁺) of J8-F1 fraction.
Key Findings:
•	The spectrum displays a wide range of m/z values, with peaks that can be detected between about 100 and 684. 
•	100.3, 120.1, 139.2, 168.2, 197.8, 245.1, 270.1, 283.0, 307.5, 329.1, 360.1, 420.0, 450.3, 496.9, 528.0, 564.2, 626.1, and 684.1 are notable m/z peaks.
•	Both low and high molecular weight compounds are present in the extract, according to these values.
Interpretation: 
The J8-F1 fraction's chemical diversity, comprising a blend of structurally diverse bioactive compounds with different molecular weights, is confirmed by the ES⁺ mass spectrum. Multiple ion peaks indicate that other small bioactive molecules may work in concert with the dominant compound shown in the DAD chromatogram to produce the observed biological activity. The presence of complex secondary metabolites, such as cyclic peptides, bioactive polyketides, alkaloids, or lipid-associated compounds, is also implied by the detection of high m/z values (up to 684).
