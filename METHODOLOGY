Prepared Mueller Hinton Agar for 100ml and autoclaved it. Poured the media into the 4 sterile petri plates and allowed it to solidify. Then the plates were uniformly swabbed the test pathogens (E.coli, Klebsia, Streptococcus and Bacillus). centrifuged the overnight cultures from DB-1 to DB-8 and separated supernatant. Then 9 wells are punctured and 100µl of centrifuged cultures are added into the wells. Then the plates were incubated for 24 hrs at 37°c. Repeat the process for 48hrs and 72hrs.

Pipette out the diluted culture into the edge of the chamber and wiped off the excess culture. Placed the Haemocytometer under a microscope at 45x.Then counted the cells in five selected squares (Four corners and one centre square).
6.4 Isolation Of Bioactive Compounds From Bacteria By Column Chromatography 
To begin the extraction process, 10 mL of bacterial strains S2, S3, J1, and J8 were individually inoculated into 40 mL of sterile nutrient broth and incubated for 24hrs at 37°C.Then the overnight cultures were subjected to centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate the cells from the supernatant. The clear supernatant was carefully collected.
 Meanwhile, a clean glass chromatography column was prepared by plugging sterile cotton at the bottom, followed by packing it with silica powder to create a stable stationary phase. A solvent mixture was then prepared using 70 mL of chloroform and 30 mL of methanol in a 70:30 ratio. This prepared solvent was poured into the column to condition the silica bed. After solvent equilibration, the previously collected supernatant from the overnight cultures was carefully loaded onto the column and allowed to run through the silica.
 From this process, multiple fractions were collected: 3 fractions each from strains S2, S3, and J1, and 2 fractions from strain J8. The obtained fractions were left to evaporate overnight to remove any residual solvents.  the resulting dried powders from each fraction were reconstituted by adding 1 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to each. Then performed antibacterial activity.

                                Table 6: Composition of Mueller Hinton (MH) Agar
400 mL of Mueller-Hinton (MH) agar was prepared and poured into 16 sterile Petri plates. After the agar solidified, seven wells were punctured in each plate and Uniformly swabbed the test pathogens (E.coli, Klebsia, Streptococcus and Bacillus). Three fractions (F1, F2, and F3) obtained from the S2 sample were labelled accordingly. For each fraction, 50 µL and 100 µL volumes were added into wells, making a total of six wells per plate. The central well in each plate was loaded with a standard antibiotic to serve as a positive control. This procedure was repeated for the remaining three bacterial strains (S3, J8 and J1) and plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours to observe the zone of inhibition and evaluate the antibacterial activity of the fractions.
6.4.2 Selection of optimal fraction: 

For advanced research, one most efficient fraction among all tested ones—either from DB-1 or DB-8—was chosen. The fraction showed better inhibition zones than the others, therefore indicating the highest bioactive potential based on the consistent and significant antibacterial activity of that particular fraction at the same concentration (either 50 µL or 100 µL) against all four test pathogens (E. coli, Klebsiella, Streptococcus, and Bacillus) was choosen for more chemical investigation. Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) was employed to analyze the majority of bioactive fractions and establish the identity of the bioavailable molecules responsible for their antibacterial effects. 
 
6.5 Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis (LC-MS):
A study using LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry) was conducted to determine the most effective fraction previously chosen for its antibacterial properties i.e. , F1 of DB 8 bacterial substance (with a concentration of 100 µL), was carried out to find the bioactive constituents generating the antibacterial activity. The LC chromatogram showed numerous peaks, pointing to a diverse mix of substances within the extract.
Among these, a prominent dominant peak was observed, representing the major compound in the sample based on its retention time and area percentage. Apart from this, many other significant and minor peaks were found, each adding to the general peak area and pointing to the existence of several different molecular components in various amounts.
Low to high molecular weights of ionized molecules were confirmed by the mass spectrum (m/z values) provided here. Among these were prospective bioactive molecules like tiny molecule antibiotics, peptides, and alkaloids. The variety of the mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios found points to the possibility that structurally distinct secondary metabolites may be present and may add to the marked antibacterial activity seen for this fraction.
