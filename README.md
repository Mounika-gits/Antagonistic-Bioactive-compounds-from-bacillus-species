# Antagonistic-Bioactive-compounds-from-bacillus-species
This study isolated and identified Bacillus species from fermented dosa batter and examined their antagonistic activity against pathogens like E. coli, Klebsiella, and Streptococcus. Bioactive compounds were extracted, purified using column chromatography, and analyzed by LC-MS, revealing potent antimicrobialÂ metabolites.
